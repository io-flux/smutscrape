# Just a scraper for smut, folks. 🍆💦

A Python-based scraper for downloading adult content from various websites. 😈

## Requirements 🧰
- Python 3.6+ 🐍
- pip 📦
- Optional: conda 🐼

## Installation 🛠️
1. `git clone https://github.com/io-flux/smutscrape.git` 🔗
2. `cd smutscrape` 📂
3. Install dependencies:
   - If using conda (recommended):
     ```
     conda create -n smutscrape python=3.10.13 🐍
     conda activate smutscrape 🚀
     pip install -r requirements.txt 📥
     ```
   - Otherwise:
     ```
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt 📥
     ```
4. Customize `config.yaml` file to your specifications, in particular the `download_destinations`, `ignored`, and `vpn` sections. 🛠️
5. `chmod +x scrape.py` 🔓
6. Optional: Create a system-wide symlink: `sudo ln -s $(realpath ./scrape.py) /usr/local/bin/scrape`. This allows you to run `scrape` from any directory (see note on "Symlink Usage")† 🔗

## Configuration 🎛️
Edit the `config.yaml` file to set up your preferences, including:
- Download destinations 📥
- User agents 🕵️
- VPN settings (if applicable) 🔒
- Ignored terms 🚫

# Usage 🚀
## Basic Usage
From the `smutscrape` folder† (where `scrape.py`, `config.yaml`, and `configs` are saved): 

```
./scrape.py {{ site config abbreviation per the configs folder }} search "{{ query }}"
```

So, for example:
- `./scrape.py 9v search sister` downloads all videos from 9vids.com's "sister" search results. 👧
- `./scrape.py ph model "owlcrystal"` downloads all videos from the model "owlcrystal" on pornhub.com. 🦉

## Symlink Usage 🔗
Note: if you take the optional step of creating a symlink at `/usr/local/bin/scrape`, you can run the `scrape` (instead of `./scrape.py`) command from any folder and don't need to `cd smutscrape` first: 

```
scrape {{ site config abbreviation per the configs folder }} search "{{ query }}"
```

Now, for example:
- `scrape sb tag "family"` downloads all videos from the "family" tag on spankbang.com. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

## Supported sites & modes 🌐
Some sites have other list modes besides `search`. The following sites and modes are presently supported:
- 9vids.com - `9v` 9️⃣
  * `search`
- incestflix.com - `if` 👨‍👩‍👧
  * `search`
  * `double_search`
- lonefun.com - `lf` 😢
  * `search`
- pornhub.com - `ph` 🟧⬛
  * `search`
  * `category`
  * `channel`
  * `model`
- spankbang.com - `sb` 👋
  * `search`
  * `tag`
  * `model`

## Direct video downloading 🎯

In addition to the modes specified for each site, you can always download individual videos using the direct URL. For example:
- `scrape https://spankbang.com/2ei5s/video/taboo+mom+son+bath` downloads the video "Taboo mom son bath" from SpankBang. 🛀🧒🏻💦👩🏻

# Contributions 🤝
Please feel free to help grow the `./configs/` library! 📚

A related need is to add a Selenium mode for sites with trickier javascript (e.g. Motherless) 🕸️

# Troubleshooting 🔧
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that your `config.yaml` is correctly set up. 📝
2. Ensure you have the latest version of the script and dependencies. 🔄
3. Check the console output for any error messages. 🚨

# Disclaimer ⚠️

No one is responsible for how you use it except you. Please scrape responsibly. 🧠💭
