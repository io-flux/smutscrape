# Just a scraper for smut, folks. üçÜ

A Python-based scraper for downloading adult content from various websites.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- pip
- Optional: conda

## Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/io-flux/smutscrape.git`
2. `cd smutscrape`
3. Install dependencies:
   - If using conda (recommended):
     ```
     conda create -n smutscrape python=3.10.13
     conda activate smutscrape
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Otherwise:
     ```
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     ```
4. Customize `config.yaml` file to your specifications, in particular the `download_destinations`, `ignored`, and `vpn` sections.
5. `chmod +x scrape.py`
6. Optional: Create a system-wide symlink: `sudo ln -s $(realpath ./scrape.py) /usr/local/bin/scrape`. This allows you to run `scrape` from any directory (see note on "Symlink Usage")‚Ä†


## Configuration
Edit the `config.yaml` file to set up your preferences, including:


# Usage
## Basic Usage
From the `smutscrape` folder‚Ä† (where `scrape.py`, `config.yaml`, and `configs` are saved): 
```
./scrape.py {{ site config abbreviation per the configs folder }} search "{{ query }}"
```

So, for example:
- `./scrape.py 9v search sister` downloads all videos from 9vids.com's "sister" search results.
- `./scrape.py ph model "owlcrystal"` downloads all videos from the model "owlcrystal" on pornhub.com.

## Symlink Usage
Note: if you take the optional step of creating a symlink at `/usr/local/bin/scrape`, you can run the `scrape` (instead of `./scrape.py`) command from any folder and don't need to `cd smutscrape` first: 
```
scrape {{ site config abbreviation per the configs folder }} search "{{ query }}"
```
Now, for example:
- `scrape sb tag "family"` downloads all videos from the "family" tag on spankbang.com.

## Supported sites & modes
Some sites have other list modes besides `search`. The following sites and modes are presently supported:
- 9vids.com - `9v`
  * `search`
- incestflix.com - `if`
  * `search`
  * `double_search`
- lonefun.com - `lf`
  * `search`
- pornhub.com - `ph`
  * `search`
  * `category`
  * `channel`
  * `model`
- spankbang.com - `sb`
  * `search`
  * `tag`
  * `model`

## Direct video downloading

In addition to the modes specified for each site, you can always download individual videos using the direct URL, e.g.:

```
./scrape https://spankbang.com/5y2rd/video/chloe+night+shower+with+brother
```

# Contributions
Please feel free to help grow the `./configs/` library!

A related need is to add a Selenium mode for sites with trickier javascript (e.g. Motherless)

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that your `config.yaml` is correctly set up.
2. Ensure you have the latest version of the script and dependencies.
3. Check the console output for any error messages.
